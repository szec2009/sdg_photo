Its implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce poverty. \nSustainable consumption and production aims at “doing more and better with less,” increasing net welfare gains from economic activities by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution along the whole lifecycle, while increasing quality of life. It involves different stakeholders, including business, consumers, policy makers, researchers, scientists, retailers, media, and development cooperation agencies, among others.\nIt also requires a systemic approach and cooperation among actors operating in the supply chain, from producer to final consumer. It involves engaging consumers through awareness-raising and education on sustainable consumption and lifestyles, providing consumers with adequate information through standards and labels and engaging in sustainable public procurement, among others.\n\nTARGETS\n12.1\nImplement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries\n12.2\nBy 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources \n12.3\nBy 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses\n12.4\nBy 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment\n12.5\nBy 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse\n12.6\nEncourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle \n12.7\nPromote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities\n12.8\nBy 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature \n12.a\nSupport developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production \n12.b\nDevelop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products \n12.c\nRationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities",

      "EN" : "Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow.\nPeople are experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, which include changing weather patterns, rising sea level, and more extreme weather events. The greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are driving climate change and continue to rise. They are now at their highest levels in history.   Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century and is likely to surpass 3 degrees Celsius this century—with some areas of the world expected to warm even more. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. \nBut climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people everywhere. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level and it requires international cooperation to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. To address climate change, countries are working to adopt a global agreement in Paris this December.\n\nTARGETS\n13.1\nStrengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries\n13.2\nIntegrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning \n13.3\nImprove education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning \n13.a\nImplement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible \n13.b\nPromote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities \n\n* Acknowledging that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, \nintergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.",
